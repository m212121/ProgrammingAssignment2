## In this file two functions are implemented:
## 
## 1. makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special 
## "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
## 
## 2. cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse
## of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above.
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed),
## then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.
